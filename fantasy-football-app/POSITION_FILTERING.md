# 🏈 Position Filtering System - Complete Guide

## ✨ New Position Filtering Features

I've completely redesigned the position filtering system to give you maximum control over which positions are displayed. Now you can show/hide any combination of positions just like the risk and undervalued filters!

## 🔧 How It Works

### **Position Filter Checkboxes**
Instead of a single dropdown, you now have individual checkboxes for each position:
- **QB** - Quarterbacks
- **RB** - Running Backs  
- **WR** - Wide Receivers
- **TE** - Tight Ends
- **K** - Kickers
- **DEF** - Team Defenses

### **Smart Filtering Logic**
- **No positions selected**: Shows ALL players (default behavior)
- **Positions selected**: Shows ONLY players from selected positions
- **Multiple positions**: Shows players from ANY of the selected positions
- **Combined with other filters**: Works seamlessly with risk, undervalued, and search filters

## 🎯 Filtering Examples

### **Show Only Running Backs**
- ✅ Check "RB" checkbox
- Leave all other position checkboxes unchecked
- Result: Shows only RB players

### **Show Quarterbacks and Wide Receivers**
- ✅ Check "QB" checkbox
- ✅ Check "WR" checkbox  
- Leave other position checkboxes unchecked
- Result: Shows QB and WR players only

### **Show All High-Risk Players (Any Position)**
- ✅ Check "High Risk Only 🚩" checkbox
- Leave all position checkboxes unchecked
- Result: Shows high-risk players from all positions

### **Show Only Undervalued Running Backs**
- ✅ Check "RB" checkbox
- ✅ Check "Undervalued Only 💎" checkbox
- Result: Shows only undervalued RB players

### **Show High-Risk Quarterbacks Only**
- ✅ Check "QB" checkbox
- ✅ Check "High Risk Only 🚩" checkbox
- Result: Shows only high-risk QB players
